## 1. What is Risk?
Risk is the potential for a threat to exploit a vulnerability and cause harm to an asset.

**Formula:**  
`Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact`

---

## 2. Key Terms
- **Asset:** Something valuable to protect (data, system, reputation).  
- **Threat:** Anything that can cause harm (malware, insider, natural event).  
- **Vulnerability:** Weakness that could be exploited.  
- **Control:** A safeguard that reduces risk (patches, policies, encryption).

## 3. Example
| Asset | Threat | Vulnerability | Impact | Control |
|--------|---------|----------------|----------|-----------|
| Employee data | Phishing | Weak password reuse | High | MFA & awareness training |

## 4. Takeaway
Effective risk management is about balancing protection with practicality — applying the right controls to reduce likelihood and impact.
