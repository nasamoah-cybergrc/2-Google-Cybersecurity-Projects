# Google Cybersecurity Certificate Projects

This repository showcases key projects and practical exercises completed during my **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate**.  
These tasks helped me understand how to identify threats, respond to incidents, and protect organizational data.

## 🧠 Skills Practiced
- Security Operations Center (SOC) basics  
- Threat identification and risk mitigation  
- Incident response documentation  
- SIEM and log analysis (using simulated data)  
- Access control and authentication management  

## 🗂️ Files to Explore
- `phishing_incident_report.md` – sample report documenting a phishing attack response  
- `risk_analysis_basics.md` – short summary of key risk concepts  
- `siem_log_review.md` – example of how alerts are analyzed in a SIEM

This stage strengthened my security awareness and gave me hands-on experience with analysis and reporting — essential for transitioning into **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)**.
